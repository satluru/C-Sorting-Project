# C-Sorting-Project

# Implemented sorting algorithm in C++ language for maximum efficiency  
# Applied if/else statements and for loops to loop through the size of the array and show the array fully sorted 
# Utilized a displaying method to show the number of actions each sorting problem performed 
# Counts the number of times the array takes to be fully sorted
